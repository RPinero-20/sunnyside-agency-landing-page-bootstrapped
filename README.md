## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

For styles

### What I learned

I focused on using and organizing flex and grid templates to get a business card organized and visible on different devices.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>IÂ´m proud to learning this:</h1>
```
```css
.item-1{
		grid-area: 1/ 1/ 2/ 3;
	}
```
```
